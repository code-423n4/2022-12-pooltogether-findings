[GAS-1] Use Custom Errors
Instead of using error strings, to reduce deployment and runtime cost, you should use Custom Errors. This would save both deployment and runtime cost. https://blog.soliditylang.org/2021/04/21/custom-errors/

[GAS-2] Usage of uints/ints smaller than 32 bytes (256 bits) incurs overhead
When using elements that are smaller than 32 bytes, your contractâ€™s gas usage may be higher. This is because the EVM operates on 32 bytes at a time. Therefore, if the element is smaller than that, the EVM must use more operations in order to reduce the size of the element from 32 bytes to the desired size.

[GAS-4] ++I/I++ SHOULD BE UNCHECKED{++I}/UNCHECKED{I++} WHEN IT IS NOT POSSIBLE FOR THEM TO OVERFLOW, AS IS THE CASE WHEN USED IN FOR- AND WHILE-LOOPS:
The unchecked keyword is new in solidity version 0.8.0, so this only applies to that version or higher, which these instances are. This saves 30-40 gas per loop.

[GAS-5] STORAGE POINTER TO A STRUCTURE IS CHEAPER THAN COPYING EACH VALUE OF THE STRUCTURE INTO MEMORY, SAME FOR ARRAY AND MAPPING
It may not be obvious, but every time you copy a storage struct/array/mapping to a memory variable, you are literally copying each member by reading it from storage, which is expensive. And when you use the storage keyword, you are just storing a pointer to the storage, which is much cheaper.
