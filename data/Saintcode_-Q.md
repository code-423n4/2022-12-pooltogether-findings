## USUAL SUSPECTS: LACK OF ZERO CHECKS FOR NEW ADDRESSES
Constructors donâ€™t have zero-checks, which could force a re-deployment, funds are not at risk in those cases.

## HARD-CODED GAS LIMITS
These numbers are not future-proof as some hardforks introduce changes to gas costs. These potential future changes to gas costs might break some of the functionalities of the smart contracts that use these constants. This is something to keep in mind. If some hardfork, would break a smart contract using these numbers you would need to deploy new contracts with adjusted gas limit constants. Or you can also have these gas limits be mutable by admins on-chain. For example, these values dont need to be immutable:

-EthereumToOptimismRelayer.sol line 26
-EthereumToPolygonRelayer.sol line 20
