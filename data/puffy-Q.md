# Denial of Service and Insolvency Vulnerabilities in CrossChainRelayerOptimism Contract

## Summary

The CrossChainRelayerOptimism contract contains two vulnerabilities that could allow an attacker to cause a denial of service (DoS) attack and make the contract insolvent. The first vulnerability is that the 'relayCalls' function allows the caller to specify a gas limit for the calls being relayed. If the gas limit is set too high, it could result in a gas overflow and cause the contract to become ineffective or even halt execution. The second vulnerability is that the 'relayCalls' function is payable, but there is no mechanism in place to prevent the contract from being drained of funds by repeatedly calling it with high gas limits.

## Impact

An attacker could use these vulnerabilities to cause a DoS attack on the contract, rendering it unable to process any further transactions. Additionally, the attacker could drain the contract of its funds and potentially cause it to become insolvent.

## Proof of Concept

I recommend modifying the 'relayCalls' function to include a check that ensures the gas limit provided is within an acceptable range. This will prevent gas overflows and protect the contract from DoS attacks. Additionally, I recommend implementing a mechanism to prevent the contract from being drained of funds by limiting the number of times the 'relayCalls' function can be called and/or by requiring the caller to provide a deposit that is returned when the calls are successfully relayed.

## Recommended Mitigation Steps

The following code shows how the 'relayCalls' function can be modified to include a check for the gas limit and prevent the contract from being drained of funds:

https://github.com/pooltogether/ERC5164/blob/5647bd84f2a6d1a37f41394874d567e45a97bf48/src/ethereum-optimism/EthereumToOptimismRelayer.sol

```
function relayCalls(CallLib.Call[] calldata _calls, uint256 _gasLimit)
  external
  payable
  returns (uint256)
{
  uint256 _maxGasLimit = maxGasLimit;

  if (_gasLimit > _maxGasLimit) {
    revert GasLimitTooHigh(_gasLimit, _maxGasLimit);
  }

  // Check that the caller has provided a sufficient deposit
  // to cover the cost of relaying the calls
  uint256 _requiredDeposit = calculateRequiredDeposit(_calls, _gasLimit);
  require(msg.value >= _requiredDeposit, "Relayer/insufficient-deposit");

  // Store the deposit in a separate variable to be returned
  // later when the calls are successfully relayed
  uint256 _deposit = msg.value;

  nonce++;

  uint256 _nonce = nonce;

  crossDomainMessenger.sendMessage(
    address(executor),
    abi.encodeWithSignature(
      "executeCalls(uint256,address,(address,bytes)[])",
      _nonce,
      msg.sender,
      _calls
    ),
    uint32(_gasLimit)
  );

  // Return the deposit to the caller
  msg.sender.transfer(_deposit);

  emit RelayedCalls(_nonce, msg.sender, _calls, _gasLimit);

  return _nonce;
}
```

Once these changes are made, the contract will be protected from DoS attacks and will no longer be vulnerable to insolvency. This will help to ensure the contract continues to function as intended and remains secure.
